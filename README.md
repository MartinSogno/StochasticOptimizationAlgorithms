StochasticOptimizationAlgorithms

The solutions to the Home Problems made in the Stochastic Optimization Algorithms courses in Chalmers, by Prof. M.Wahde. This course is about some heuristic optimizations inspired from biology. The main focus is on Evolutionnary Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm. Some classical optimization methods are also treated.

HP 1.1 -> Penalty method for optimization \
HP 1.3 -> Function optimization with Genetic Algorithm

HP 2.1 -> TSP, both with Genetic Algorithm and Ant System \
HP 2.2 -> Particle Swarm \
HP 2.3 -> Optimization of truck braking system, Genetic Algorithm \
HP 2.4 -> Function fitting using LGP, Genetic Algorithm
