# AlgorithmicMachineLearning
These projects were made during the Algorithmic Machine Learning course, in Eurecom, with Prof. Pietro Michiardi. We had two weeks
to complete the notebooks on Recommender systems and Monte Carlo financial predictions, and four weeks to do the challenge on prediction
of houses prices.

Recommender systems : analyse of a music database, and creation of a recommender system, and optimization of parameters in function of 
the performance evaluation.

Monte Carlo Simulations : financial prediction thanks to Monte Carlo method, by correlating the variation of prices of products to financial
index.

Prediction of house prices challenge : totally free notebook, we just had to find several methods to estimate the prices of houses. We
implemented several variations of linear regression, some KNN, and a xgboost method.
